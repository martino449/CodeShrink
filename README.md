How to Use the Program:
Run the Program:

Clone or download the repository containing the program, or copy the script to your local machine.
Place the Python script you want to compress in the same directory.
Choose the Compression Option:

Run self_compress.py and follow the prompts:
bash
Copia codice
python self_compress.py
In the menu, select option 1 to compress a Python file.
Input the Filename:

Enter the name of the Python file you want to compress (e.g., example.py).
Enter the name of the output file (e.g., compressed_example.py).
Output:

The program generates a self-decompressing script with the name you provided. This script contains both the compressed code and a routine to decompress and execute it.
Example:
Let's say you have a script named example.py that you want to compress:

Place example.py in the same directory as the program.
Run the program:
bash
Copia codice
python self_compress.py
Choose option 1 to compress the script, and provide the necessary file names.
Afterward, the program creates a file like compressed_example.py. When anyone runs this new script:

bash
Copia codice
python compressed_example.py
It will automatically decompress and execute the original script!

Use Cases:
Code Distribution: Share compressed and self-extracting Python code to save bandwidth or storage.
Code Obfuscation: Protect sensitive code by compressing and obfuscating the original content.
Optimization: Reduce script sizes when transferring or storing them in size-constrained environments.
This makes the tool highly useful for scenarios where both size optimization and ease of execution are needed!
